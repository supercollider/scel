;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file is included in the distribution in order to convey system
;; installation variables which are known at compile time, but only when
;; the library is installed with cmake along with SuperCollider source.
;;
;; When using the stand-alone package, this file can be ignored and
;; the constants it defines will have no effect.

;;; Code:

(defconst sclang-system-data-dir "@PKG_DATA_DIR@"
  "Installation dependent data directory.
Bound only when library is installed with SuperCollider.")

(provide 'sclang-vars)
